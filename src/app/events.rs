//! the `action_for_key` keybinding lookup, and all mouse/PTY input methods.
//!
//! **Import pattern:** `use super::*` is intentional — these methods live on `CoordApp`
//! and need the full parent namespace (all quadraui types, app-field types, and bindings
//! from other extracted modules). Pure-function submodules (`format.rs`, `data.rs`) use
//! explicit imports because their dependency surface is small and stable.
