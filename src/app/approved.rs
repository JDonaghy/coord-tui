//! Approved work items ActivityBar panel (#2532, ms-67 contract §3).
//!
//! A plain aligned-column list of portal submissions ready for
//! decomposition into coordinator work — today `signoff.approved`
//! submissions (once `coord-portal`#132's operator "start work" override
//! lands, that widens too, but that is a wire-shape amendment, not a client
//! change). Modeled on the Audit panel's own list, not the bordered
//! `DataTable` grid Queue uses — no sortable numeric columns and no
//! drag-reorder verb here (contract §3c).
//!
//! **No fetch of its own.** Like Queue, rows ride the existing `/board`
//! poll (`BoardData::approved_submissions`, server-computed by
//! `coord/approved_work.py` and injected into the projection by
//! `coord/serve_app.py`'s board builder — `repos` is resolved there from
//! `portal.project_repos` in `coordinator.yml`, so this module never reads
//! config directly). See `SidebarView::Approved`'s doc comment for why the #2336
//! daemon-host guard that gates `coord portal outbox/events` does not apply
//! here: this panel only ever talks to `/board` over HTTP, same as every
//! other panel in this app.
//!
//! **Detail pane (contract §3e).** Enter opens an inline detail region
//! below the list, headed by a manually-authored `"── Submission Detail
//! ──"` divider line (NOT `ListView::bordered`'s rounded-box title overlay
//! — quadraui's `draw_list` renders that as `"╭─ Title ─────╮"`, a single
//! dash before the title rather than the two the contract's convention
//! pins verbatim, so reusing it would silently drift from the contract).
//! Long field values (outcome/audience/done/constraints) word-wrap with
//! continuation lines indented to the value column (13 chars, contract
//! §3e / §6.2) — the wrap width is derived from the actual painted detail
//! rect so a value's tail is never clipped by the renderer regardless of
//! terminal width.
