//! Per-panel document tabs with VS Code preview/pin semantics (#2282, ms-65 §2).
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! Today both detail panes are a pure function of the sidebar selection: move
//! the selection and the issue you were reading is gone. [`DocTabs`] adds a
//! second, *independent* notion of "what am I looking at" — an ordered set of
//! open documents per panel, one of them active, and **at most one preview
//! slot** — so two issues can be held open at once and returning to one is a
//! click rather than a re-navigation.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! A document key is `(repo, issue_number)`. Each [`PanelScope`] owns its own
//! [`DocTabGroup`]: an ordered `Vec<DocKey>`, the index of the active tab, and
//! optionally the index of the single preview tab. The scope split is what
//! keeps Board's and Pipeline's sets from merging (contract §3b) — #2282
//! wired `Board`; #2284 wires `Pipeline` against this same shape, one
//! `DocTabGroup` per scope, so the two never merge, reorder or drop into
//! each other when the active panel switches.
//!
//! # Open semantics (contract §2e)
//!
//! 1. Open a document that is already open → activate its tab. No new tab, no
//!    replace ([`DocTabGroup::open_preview`]'s first branch).
//! 2. Open a not-yet-open document while a preview tab exists → **replace the
//!    preview in place**: same index, same active state.
//! 3. Otherwise → append a new preview tab and activate it.
//! 4. Pinning ([`DocTabGroup::pin`]) is open-or-activate *followed by*
//!    promotion — it drops `is_preview`, which is what makes the tab stop being
//!    the replaceable slot.
//!
//! Invariant, checked by `debug_assert` on every mutation: there is never more
//! than one preview tab, and `preview`/`active` always index a live tab.
//!
//! # Why not quadraui's `TabGroupController`
//!
//! Its content is a `Box<dyn BackendWidget>`, which cannot borrow `&CoordApp`
//! — the detail pane's content is derived from app state on every frame, so
//! there is nothing to box. quadraui #596/#597 (`WorkspaceController` + the
//! preview tier) are the intended long-term home for this model and do not
//! exist at any pushed quadraui rev yet; when they land, this module is the
//! thing to delete in favour of them. The public surface here is deliberately
//! small and free of rendering concerns so that swap stays cheap.

/// The scope's panes and the [`SplitTree`] that arranges them.
///
/// #2288 applies #2282's per-scope model **one level deeper**: a scope owns
/// an ordered list of panes, each of which is a whole [`DocTabGroup`] (its
/// own tab order, its own active tab, its own single preview slot, its own
/// per-document sub-state). Exactly one pane is focused; every existing
/// mutation path — open, pin, close, cycle — reaches the focused pane
/// through [`DocTabs::group`] / [`DocTabs::group_mut`] and so needs no
/// change at all.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// - `panes` is never empty (contract §9: "a scope always has ≥1 pane", the
///   reason [`Self::close_pane`] is a no-op at one pane).
/// - `focused` is always a valid index into `panes`.
/// - With **one** pane the whole type is inert: [`Self::split_tree`] is a
///   bare `Leaf`, nothing paints a divider, and the rendering is
///   byte-identical to pre-#2288 (contract §9's last bullet).
///
/// # Why the tree is derived, not stored
///
/// `ratio` is the only mutable state a two-leaf tree has, so holding a
/// `SplitTree` field as well would be a second source of truth for the same
/// number (and would cost `DocTabs` its `Eq`, since `SplitTree` carries an
/// `f32`). [`Self::split_tree`] builds the tree from `panes.len()` + `ratio`
/// on demand, and every geometry question — leaf rects, divider column,
/// divider hit-test, drag-to-ratio — is answered by asking that tree via
/// quadraui's own `layout()` / `hit_test_*`, never by hand-rolled math.

    /// never capture its writes. Without the pin, exactly that happened:
    /// every unsandboxed app's tab clicks were redirected into whichever
    /// sandbox happened to be live at that instant, and the sandboxing
    /// test lost its own `tabs.json` to a neighbour (#2288 — reproducible
    /// on essentially every full-suite run once the `board_split_2288`
    /// slice started driving tab strips for its full length instead of
    /// panicking on its first assertion).

    /// The residue this does NOT fix is an app *constructed* inside another

    /// repo-wide follow-up, or a single-threaded acceptance binary.
    ///
    /// # Why the residue cannot be closed from inside this crate

    /// The residue narrows to ONE interleaving: a foreign thread calls
    /// `claim_origin` for a sandbox in the gap between `HomeSandbox::new`'s
    /// `set_var("HOME", …)` and the owning test's own `make_test_app`
    /// (`restart_with` spends one `fs::write` there, so ~0.2 ms of a ~70 ms
    /// sandbox window). First-loader-wins then names the foreign thread, so
    /// it reads the seeded `tabs.json` its own test never wrote *and* the
    /// owner is refused its own file. A foreign thread that arrives any
    /// LATER in the window is already handled correctly — it is refused and
    /// falls back to `origin == None`.
    ///
    /// That gap is not closable here, because at claim time the owner and a
    /// foreign thread are indistinguishable from process state: `HOME` is
    /// per-PROCESS, not per-thread, so both observe the identical value, the

/// `pipeline_issues_from_cache` only ever emits a `PipelineIssue` it found in
/// `open_issues` — including the untracked-epic-child backfill, whose
/// "aged out of the `open_issues` cache (#771)" arm `continue`s rather than

/// # Known remaining gap (Board scope) — out of scope for #2481
///
/// The Board sidebar is NOT sourced from `open_issues` alone:

/// `coord assign` before its repo's first `coord sync` (or one that has aged
/// out of the cache) still gets a Board row — the same "assignment-only Board
/// entries" case `apply_pending_data`'s terminal-session pruning already
/// calls out by name. A Board document tab opened on such a row is still
/// pruned by the next tick, because that issue is in neither spelling here.
/// #2481 explicitly scopes itself to Pipeline and asks for a follow-up rather
/// than a fix; sourcing the Board half from `board_issues_cache` (which is
