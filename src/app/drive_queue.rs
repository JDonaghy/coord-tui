//! The operator-declared `coord drive` work queue (#1750 DQ-3 / #1755) —
//! an always-visible status-bar segment, the Queue panel (#1866/#1867), and
//! "Add to drive queue" on the Pipeline row menu.
//!
//! The TUI is where the operator reads the pipeline and forms the intent
//! "that one next"; before this, acting on that intent meant leaving the TUI
//! for a shell, and the epic's alert requirement ("if nothing can start,
//! alert the operator") had no surface at all.
//!
//! **Read path is entirely server-derived.** `self.data.drive_queue` is a raw
//! dump of the daemon's `drive_queue` table (`/board`'s `drive_queue` key,
//! see [`BoardDriveQueueEntry`]); nothing here recomputes a row's `state` —
//! DQ-2's tick decides `waiting`/`running`/`blocked`/`done` and this module
//! consumes that verbatim, exactly the way `fleet_health.rs` consumes a
//! probe's `severity`. The one thing derived locally is the *aggregate*
//! sentence in the status bar ([`drive_queue_status_text`]), which is a pure
//! function of the rows so it is directly testable without a driver.
//!
//! **Write path is `coord drive-queue …` through the spawn-and-toast seam**
//! (`command_runner.spawn_queued` + [`CoordApp::push_toast`], the same
//! posture as `milestone_dag.rs` / `escalation.rs`) — no direct DB access,
//! and no client-side mutation of `data.drive_queue` beyond the optimistic
//! removal `escalation.rs` already precedents.
//!
//! **One queue surface, not two (#1868).** Until #1868 this module also
//! carried a right-click detail overlay that rendered the same rows through
//! a second code path — two surfaces over one data source drift, and #1868
//! retired it now that the Queue panel is proven. The status-bar segment's
//! "Drive queue…" menu item now switches straight to the panel
//! (`SidebarView::Queue`) instead of opening a modal.
//!
//! **Import pattern:** `use super::*` is intentional — see `fleet_health.rs`
//! / `escalation.rs` / `drive.rs` for the same rationale.
